/**
 * The pix_n_flix module allows us to process still images and videos.
 *
 * An Image (which is a still image or a frame of a video) is a
 * two-dimensional array of Pixels, and a Pixel consists of red, blue and green color
 * values, each ranging from 0 to 255. To access these color values of a Pixel, we
 * provide the functions red_of, blue_of and green_of.
 *
 * A central element of pix_n_flix is the notion of a Filter, a function that is applied
 * to two Images: the source Image and the destination Image. When a Filter is installed
 * (using the function install_filter), it transforms each source Image from the live camera
 * or from a local/remote file to a destination Image that is then displayed on screen
 * in the Source Academy "Pix N Flix" tab (with a camera icon).
 *
 * The dimensions (i.e. width and height) of the displayed images can be set by the user using
 * the function set_dimensions, and all source and destination Images of the Filters will
 * also be set to the same dimensions. To access the current dimensions of the Images, the user
 * can use the functions image_width and image_height.
