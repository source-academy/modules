/**
 * 2D Phyiscs simulation module for Source Academy.
 *
 * A **vector** is defined by its coordinates (x and y). The 2D vector is used to
 * represent direction, size, position, velocity and other physical attributes in
 * the physics world. Vector manipulation and transformations between vector and array
 * types are supported.
 *
 * A **force** is defined by its direction (a vector), its magnitude, duration and
 * start time. A force is only actively applied if:
 *
 * ```
 * diff > 0 && diff < duration, where diff is world time - start time
 * ```
 *
 * A **world** is the single physics world the module is based on.
 *
 * - `set_gravity` needs to be called once at the start of the program to initialize the world
 * and set the gravity.
 * - `make_ground` and `add_wall` are optional but recommended to be used to set boundaries
 * in the world.
 *
 * An **object** is initially defined in the add function by:
 *
 * - shape: which add function was used (e.g. `add_box_object`)
 * - position: initial position
 * - velocity: initial velocity
 * - size: initial size (depends on the shape of the object)
 * - rotation: initial rotation
 * - isStatic (whether it is affected by physics)
 *
 * There are also additional attributes that can be set after an object has been added:
 *
 * - density: mass per area of object
 * - friction: how much friction the object surface has
 *
 * There are two ways to apply a force on a given object:
 *
 * - `apply_force`: applies a force to an object at a given object
 * - `apply_force_to_center`: applies a force to an object directly at its center
 *
 * Detection of collision and precise starting time are provided by:
 *
 * - `is_touching`
 * - `impact_start_time`
 *
 * After adding objects to the world, calling `update_world` will simulate the world.\
 * The suggested time step is 1/60 (seconds).
 *
 * Visualization of the physics world can also be seen in the display tab.
*
 * The following example simulates a free fall of a circle object.
 *
 * ```
 * import { set_gravity, make_vector, add_circle_object, update_world } from "physics_2d";
 *
 * const gravity = make_vector(0, -9.8);
 * set_gravity(gravity);
 *
 * make_ground(0, 1);
 *
 * const pos = make_vector(0, 100);
 * const velc = make_vector(0, 0);
 * add_circle_object(pos, 0, velc, 10, false);
 *
 * for (let i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) {
 *   update_world(1/60);
 * }
 * ```
