/**
 * The CSG module enables working with Constructive Solid Geometry in the Source
 * Academy. Users are able to program colored 3D models and interact with them
 * in a tab.
 *
 * The main objects in use are called Shapes. Users can create, operate on,
 * transform, and finally render these Shapes.
 *
 * There are also Groups, which contain Shapes, but can also contain other
 * nested Groups. Groups allow many Shapes to be transformed in tandem, as
 * opposed to having to call transform functions on each Shape individually.
 *
 * An object that is either a Shape or a Group is called an Operable. Operables
 * as a whole are stateless, which means that passing them into functions does
 * not modify the original Operable; instead, the newly created Operable is
 * returned. Therefore, it is safe to reuse existing Operables after passing
 * them into functions, as they remain immutable.
 *
 * When you are done modeling your Operables, pass them to one of the CSG
 * rendering functions to have them displayed in a tab.
 *
 * When rendering, you may optionally render with a grid and/or axes displayed,
 * depending on the rendering function used. The grid appears on the XY-plane
 * with white lines every 1 unit of distance, and slightly fainter lines every
 * 0.25 units of distance. The axes for x, y, and z are coloured red, green, and
 * blue respectively. The positive z direction is upwards from the flat plane
 * (right-handed coordinate system).
 *
 * ```js
 * // Sample usage
 * import {
 *     silver, crimson, cyan,
 *     cube, cone, sphere,
 *     intersect, union, scale, translate,
 *     render_grid_axes
 * } from "csg";
 *
 * const base = intersect(
 *     scale(cube(silver), 1, 1, 0.3),
 *     scale(cone(crimson), 1, 1, 3)
 * );
 * const snowglobe = union(
 *     translate(sphere(cyan), 0, 0, 0.22),
 *     base
 * );
 * render_grid_axes(snowglobe);
 * ```
