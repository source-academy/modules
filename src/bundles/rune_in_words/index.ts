/**
 * The module `rune_in_words` provides functions for computing with runes using text instead of graphics.
 *
 * A *Rune* is defined by its vertices (x,y,z,t), the colors on its vertices (r,g,b,a), a transformation matrix for rendering the Rune and a (could be empty) list of its sub-Runes. In this module, runes are represented as strings that approximate the way they are created. No graphical output is generated.
