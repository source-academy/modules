# Developer Documentation Server

Originally most of the developer documentation was contained within the Github repository's wiki. However, as the documentation became more comprehensive in scope and complex in design,
it was necessary to migrate to a more advanced and configurable solution.

This documentation server is powered by [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev), which takes Markdown files and renders them into a (mostly) static site.

## File Structure
All pages for the server are contained under `src`.

[`vitepress-sidebar`](https://vitepress-sidebar.cdget.com) is being used to generate the sidebar for the server. This means that entries in the sidebar appear sorted according to the file/folder names from which they originate. This is why
some folder have contents that are labelled `1-something`, `2-something` etc. Each item's value is taken from file's frontmatter, or if not present, the file's first header.

Folders produce item groups, the name of which can be customized using an `index.md` file within that folder.

```dirtree
name: bundles
children:
    - index.md
    - name: 1-getting-started
      children:
        - 1-overview.md
        - 2-start.md
        - 3-cheat.md
        - 4-faq.md
        - index.md
    - name: 2-bundle
      children:
        - name: 1-overview
          children:
            - 1-overview.md
        - name: 2-creating.md
          children:
            - 2-creating.md
        - 3-editing.md
        - name: 4-documentation
          children:
            - 4-documentation.md
        - 5-type_map.md
        - 6-compiling.md
        - index.md
```

The above file structure produces the menu below:

Each item takes its title value from either the frontmatter (if available) or the first heading of each page.

`index.md` files are only used to title the menus, they are not intended for navigation, though are navigable to if the user enters the address manually, so it is still recommended to keep some basic
documentation in those pages or create rewrites so that users are automatically redirected away from those pages. Here are the contents of <nobr><code>2-bundle/index.md</code></nobr>:

<<< ../../modules/2-bundle/index.md

Instead, the links in the sidebar link to the page (if it is a markdown file), or to a child within the folder that has the same name as that folder.

## Documentation for `modules-lib`
The documentation for `@sourceacademy/modules-lib` is automatically generated by Typedoc. The configuration options for this generation are found in that folder. The documentation for `@sourceacademy/modules-lib` should be built before this server is built.

::: details help pls
Supposedly Vitepress can embed React components, which would be nice for us to have working demonstrations of our React components. Unfortunately, I have never
been able to get that to work. You can start [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/discussions/2183) if you want to help figure this out.

## Diagrams
Diagrams (such as the one seen [here](/buildtools/4-resolution.html#bundle-resolution)) are supported via the [`mermaid`](https://mermaid.js.org) rendering engine and provided with the [Vitepress plugin for mermaid](https://github.com/emersonbottero/vitepress-plugin-mermaid).
Simply use a Markdown code block with the `mermaid` language tag.

## Code Snippets
`vitepress` provides the ability for a Markdown document to "import" a code snippet from an external file. This function is documented [here](https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown#import-code-snippets).

Throughout many files in the repository, you will see VSCode `#region` comments. These comments are used to mark out a VSCode region in Typescript/Javascript and are used by the doc server to extract only
a specified portion of the code within the file. Do not remove these comments unless absolutely necessary.

## Tree Diagrams
Directory tree diagrams like the one below
```txt
this
├── is
├── a
└── tree
    └── diagram
```
are generated via their own markdown plugin, the details of which can be found [here](./2-dirtree).
