# Repository Development Tools

The `@sourceacademy/modules-repotools` package itself has a bunch of utilities for working with the repository.

Below is a list of other tools:

- [Development Server](./1-devserver)
- [ESLint](./2-linting)
- [Vitest Reporters](./3-reporters)
- [VSCode](./4-vscode)
- [Yarn](./5-yarn)
- [Docs Server](./6-docserver/1-overview)
- [Github Workflows](./7-workflows/index)

You may also want to refer to the Source Academy wide developer conventions which can be found [here](https://github.com/source-academy/general/wiki/Conventions-and-practices).
