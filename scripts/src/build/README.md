# Source Academy Modules Build System
This folder contains all the code used to build Source modules. By default, the `build` command will build all assets, but a specific subcommand can be used to build only certain assets.

You can refer to the specific documentation for each type of asset:\
- [Building documentation](docs/README.md)
- [Building modules](modules/README.md)
