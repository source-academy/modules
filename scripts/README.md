# Scripts
The script system uses [`commander`](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) to parse command line options and run the corresponding Javascript code.

The source code for the scripts is located in `src` and written in Typescript. Run `yarn build:scripts` to compile the scripts into Javascript if necessary. The compiled code is present in `bin`.
