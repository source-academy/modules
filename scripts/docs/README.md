# Source

Source is a family of languages, designed for the textbook [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Adaptation](https://source-academy.github.io/sicp/) (SICP JS). The languages are called Source §1, Source §2, Source §3 and Source §4, corresponding to the respective chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the textbook. Each previous Source language is a sublanguage of the next, and all Source languages are sublanguages of JavaScript. (Chapter 5 does not require any features beyond Source §4.) This webpage contains the description of the Source languages and the libraries they come with.
